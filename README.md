# ECE-GY-9163-Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Lab 4

Running the code:
To run the code, first download the models 'bd_net.h5' and 'bd_weights.h5' from the 'models' folder in the 'Lab3' from the link 'https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020/tree/master'.
Also download the dataset from the link provided in the README of the same folder 'Lab3'. Save both the datasets and models in a single folder.

Upload the folder on Jupyter and open the code 'MLCybersecLab4.ipynb' from this library if you are using Jupyter Notebook.

If you are using Google Colab, upload the models and datasets to your drive and then mount the drive to the colab notebook using the following code:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

We are all set to run the whole code now on any environment.
